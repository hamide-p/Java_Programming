char: primitive datatype that holds a single character
     char letter = 'a';

ASCII
    every character has a number related to it

String
    holds a sequence of characters
    non primitive/ object

    Q: What is the difference between "A" and 'A'
        "A" is a String type
        'A' is a char type
        the datatypes are different

Concatenation:

    operator +

    used to combine something with a String -> the result is a String

        String + String -> concatenation
        int + String -> concatenation
        char + char -> addition
        int + int -> addition
