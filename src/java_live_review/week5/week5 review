Methods

	- methods are important for programming. They help you create reusable code

	- We have used methods from some classes already:
		String methods, Scanner methods

	- We can also make our own custom methods
		We can write some code/ some action one time and call it anywhere in the project

    - to understand a method:
        what is the method (name)
        what are the parameters
        what is the return
__________________________________________________________________

Return type

	void: runs some code and nothing is returned from the method
	return type: runs some code and return a single value back

	if a method defines a return type instead of void, then there MUST be a return value.
		-> The return value is given using the 'return' keyword

	 return method work with and without parameters
__________________________________________________________________

Parameters/arguments

        parameters are information needed for a method to run. That information is used in the method

        you can define as many parameters as needed

    -> What is the difference between parameter and argument
            parameter: when you declare the method you define which parameters the method should have

            argument: when calling the method, the actual value given into the method call is the argument

                Ex:
                    charAt(int index){}
                    int index -> parameter
                    charAt(0)
                    0 -> argument
__________________________________________________________________

Method overloading

	method has the same name, but different parameters

		-> allow us to have different methods that share a similar idea and work with different inputs

		+ readability
		+ re usability

        - parameter datatypes can be changed or the number of parameters

        one example we have seen:

            substring(num)
            substring(num, num)

            We use substring two ways, with one number parameter, or with two number parameters
            This method is overloaded so it means it has the same name but differnt ways to use the method

        return type DOES NOT overload your method

        you need to overload the method by changing the parameters
            -> BUT IF the method is overloaded then you can change the return type
                -> Return type can be the same or different if overloaded

IQ: Can you overload a main method?
Yes, we can add a new method with name main, and have different parameters, but it will not act as the normal main method
__________________________________________________________________

loops

    Loops in programming are used to repeat statements multiple times

        You can define some action/code that you want to execute repeatedly

    iteration: each cycle of the code, each time the statements execute

    infinite loop: a loop that continues execute without stopping. A loop will be infinite if the boolean expression is always true and never changes to false

	For loop: when there is a fixed number of iterations

        for(initialization; boolean condition; update){
            // statements
        }
