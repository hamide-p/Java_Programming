Topics: Arrays Intro

package name: day19_array


Data Structure: to use the data efficiently. Allows us to store the data in an organized manner

			1. Array // is mutable, array objects  stored in heap memory outside of the string pool
			2. Collection // they don't support primitives-->they have to be converted
			3. Map


regular variable:

		DataType  variableName;
		int        age;
		char       gender;
		String     name;
		....

Array:
		DataType[]  variableName;



Arrays Utility class:  Arrays

		presented in "java.utilities"


		import java.utilities.Arrays;



Task:
	1. Write a program that can find the maximum number from an array

	2. Write a program that can find the minimum number from an array

	3. Create a char array and store all the alphabet letters in ascending order

	4. Create a char array and store all the alphabet letters in descending order

	5. AverageNumber:
	            1. Ask the user how many numbers they want to enter
	            2. get all the inputs from the user and store them into an array
	            3. Iterate the array & return the average number


    6. Items
			1. Create an array named items with the length of 5
			2. Create an array named prices with the length of 5
			3. Ask user to enter item name and price 5 times and store them into the items and prices arrays
			4. calculate the total price of the arrays
			5. display each item name and price in separate lines

						ItemName -- Price
